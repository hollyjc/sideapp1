# Side APP - Time Management App :star::alarm_clock:
========================================================================
## This application is ideal for parents (especially with young children), or people who struggle with time management. When you log into the app you select if you are getting ready by yourself, or if you also have children to get ready (if so - how many). 
## You will then be asked what time you need to be at your destination, and how long it takes to get there. The application will then prompt you to check off what you (and your child/ren need if selected), such as: have a shower, do hair and make up, pack kidâ€™s lunches, dress the child, etc. The application will calculate the time it takes to do all of these tasks, and tell you what time you need to wake up to ensure you have enough time to do all of your activities and get to where you need to be on time.
